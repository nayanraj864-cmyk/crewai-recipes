# 🤖 crewai-recipes

**A public library of ready-to-run CrewAI multi-agent workflows — powered by NVIDIA NIM (Llama 3.1 8B by default; swap to 70B with one env var: `LLM_MODEL`).**

## 30-second start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Karan-Raj-KR/crewai-recipes.git
cd crewai-recipes/recipes/lead-qualification
pip install -r requirements.txt
LLM_API_KEY=nvapi-YOUR_KEY python run.py --company "Acme Corp" --description "40-person B2B SaaS"
```

> **Free key:** Sign up at [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com/) → browse models → **Get API Key**. The free tier gives generous monthly credits.
> **Windows:** Pass the key via `.env` file instead of the inline prefix — see [Quickstart](#-quickstart).

## What is this?

`crewai-recipes` is a community-driven cookbook of **self-contained, production-ready multi-agent workflows** built with [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI) and [NVIDIA NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/). Recipes default to **Llama 3.1 8B Instruct** — fast and reliable on the NIM free tier — and you can switch to the larger 3.3 70B model with a single environment variable (`LLM_MODEL`). Each recipe is a standalone Python project you can clone, configure with a single API key, and run in minutes.

No boilerplate hunting. No stitching together random blog posts. Just clone → set key → run.

## Why crewai-recipes?

| | Rolling your own | `crewai-recipe` |
|---|---|---|
| **Time to first run** | Write agent, task, crew, and LLM config from scratch | `git clone` → `pip install` → set one env var → run |
| **LLM / provider config** | Hardcode model, base URL, and API key in source | `LLM_API_KEY`, `LLM_MODEL`, `LLM_BASE_URL` env vars — swap providers without touching code |
| **Transient error handling** | Roll your own or skip it | `max_retries=3` pre-wired: exponential backoff on timeouts, 429s, and 5xx, honouring `Retry-After` |
| **CI validation** | Set up yourself | ruff lint, format check, and import-wiring assertions on every push to `main` |
| **Entry points** | Write from scratch | `run.py` (argparse CLI) and `main.py` (edit-and-run sample) included per recipe |
| **Local browser UI** | Build separately | `/playground` — FastAPI + HTML, runs locally, key never leaves your machine |

## ⚡ Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Karan-Raj-KR/crewai-recipes.git
cd crewai-recipes

# 2. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies for a recipe (example: lead-qualification)
cd recipes/lead-qualification
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Set your API key (free at https://build.nvidia.com/)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set: LLM_API_KEY=nvapi-...

# 5. Run the recipe
python run.py --company "Acme Corp" --description "A 40-person B2B SaaS..."
```

> **Tip:** Copy `.env.example` → `.env` inside each recipe folder and fill in your key — `python-dotenv` is pre-wired in every recipe.

> **Pick a model (optional):** Recipes default to `meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` (fast, reliable on the free tier). To use stronger reasoning, set `LLM_MODEL=meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct` in your `.env` — no code changes needed. Note the 70B model can be slower and occasionally rate-limited on the free tier.

## 🎮 Local Playground

Want to test recipes in your browser instead of the CLI? The repo includes a lightweight, local-only web playground. **Your API key never leaves your machine.**

```bash
cd playground
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the playground server
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
Then open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser.

---

## 🐳 Run with Docker

No Python setup required. The easiest way is via Docker Compose — it starts the full **web playground** with one command:

```bash
# 1. Set your API key
cp playground/.env.example playground/.env
# Edit playground/.env: LLM_API_KEY=nvapi-your-key-here

# 2. Start the playground (FastAPI + uvicorn on port 8000)
docker compose up playground
```

Then open **[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)** — all recipes are available in the UI. 🎉

Want to run a single recipe from the CLI instead?

```bash
docker build --build-arg MODE=recipe --build-arg RECIPE=lead-qualification -t crewai-lead .
docker run --rm --env-file recipes/lead-qualification/.env crewai-lead \
    --company "Acme Corp" --description "A 40-person B2B SaaS startup"
```

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are very welcome! Whether you're fixing a bug, improving docs, or submitting a brand-new recipe — please read **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** first.

Quick summary:
- Each recipe lives in its own directory under `recipes/`
- Must use CrewAI + NVIDIA NIM (default `meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct`, 70B optional via `LLM_MODEL`); other models can be optional extras
- Include a `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, `run.py`, and `.env.example`
- Open an issue first for major new recipes so we can align before you build

New to the project? Start with an issue labeled **[good first issue](https://github.com/Karan-Raj-KR/crewai-recipes/labels/good%20first%20issue)** — each one is scoped to be a self-contained, mergeable PR.
