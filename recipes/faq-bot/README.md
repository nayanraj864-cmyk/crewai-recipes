---

## Usage

```bash
python run.py --question "CUSTOMER QUESTION"
python run.py --question "CUSTOMER QUESTION" --name "Customer Name"
```

### Options

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--question` | ✅ Yes | — | The customer's question (wrap in quotes) |
| `--name` | No | `there` | Customer name for personalised greeting |
| `--help` | No | — | Show help and exit |

### Examples

```bash
# Basic pricing question
python run.py --question "How much does Orbitly cost?"

# Personalised question
python run.py --question "Do you offer refunds?" --name "Alex"

# Integration question
python run.py --question "Does Orbitly integrate with Slack?" --name "Priya"

# Test fallback (topic not in KB)
python run.py --question "Do you have a mobile app for Android?" --name "Jordan"
```

## Knowledge Base Topics

Loaded dynamically from `knowledge_base.yaml`:

| # | Topic | Question |
|---|-------|---------|
| 1 | Pricing | How much does Orbitly cost? |
| 2 | Free Trial | Can I try Orbitly before paying? |
| 3 | Data Import | Can I import from Jira or Trello? |
| 4 | Integrations | Which tools does Orbitly integrate with? |
| 5 | Security | Is my data secure? Is Orbitly GDPR compliant? |
| 6 | Cancellation & Refunds | What happens if I cancel? Do you offer refunds? |

Questions outside these topics trigger a graceful fallback directing the customer to support@orbitly.example.com.

---

## Extending the Knowledge Base

The FAQ content is separated from logic in `knowledge_base.yaml`. Add a new entry to `knowledge_base.yaml`:

```yaml
- topic: mobile app
  question: Is there a mobile app?
  answer: >-
    Yes! Orbitly is available on iOS and Android. Search 'Orbitly' in the App Store or Google Play.
```

### Custom Knowledge Base Path
You can point to your own external YAML knowledge base file by setting the `FAQ_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_PATH` environment variable:

```bash
export FAQ_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_PATH="/path/to/my_custom_faq.yaml"
python run.py --question "Custom FAQ question"
```

---

## Expected Output

The pricing question above, showing the **final result block** (the verbose
per-agent trace is omitted). Captured from a real call to NVIDIA NIM
`meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` on 2026-07-08:

   Question : How much does Orbitly cost?

Hi Priya,

Orbitly offers three plans: Solo ($0/month, 1 user, 3 projects), Team
($29/month per user, unlimited projects, priority support), and Enterprise
(custom pricing, SSO, dedicated SLA, audit logs). Annual billing gives you
2 months free.

Is there anything else I can help with?
